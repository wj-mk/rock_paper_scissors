# Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

## The Odin Project - Web Development 101

In this mini-project I created the game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in JavaScript. 

The game prompts the user to choose one of the three options, and then randomly selects one of the options as the computers selection. It reports the result, and gives a point to the winner. Five rounds are played, at which the overall winner is stated. 

Version 1 plays in the console, while version 2 is played in a web browser.
