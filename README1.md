# Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

## The Odin Project - Web Development 101

In this mini-project I created the game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in JavaScript. The game was created in an HTML document with a script tag. Currently, the game is played from the console.

The game prompts the user to choose one of the three options, and then randomly selects on of the options as the computers selection. It reports the result, and gives a point to the winner. Another round is played until someone reaches five points, at which the overall winner is stated.
